                <h4>About Me: </h4>
                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Satish Parajuli and welcome to my website! This is where I list some of the cool(ish) things that I have done.
                    I am currently a sophomore pursuing my bachelors degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
                </p>
                <h4>Background & Expirence: </h4>
                <p>
                    I am originally from Pokhara (image on the right), Nepal and I moved to the United States in 2008. Since then , I have lived in North Texas for 16 years. 
                    I have had an interest in computers since I was very little, as my dad used to fix computers back in Nepal. In sixth grade I had my first real hands-on experience when I rebuilt an HP Pavilion desktop computer from 2008, 
                    that we bought when we first came to America. After that, in seventh grade, I built my own gaming computer.
                    Since then, I also gained an appreciation for the software portion of computers as well. I took my first computer science class in ninth grade. The class focused on the basics (strings, arrays, classes, etc.). Then I moved onto AP Computer Science and Computer Science III. I thoroughly enjoyed both classes and they helped me to gain a greater appreciation for software and how it can be transferred to real life as well.
                    Due to my love for both software and hardware, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. 
                    During eleventh grade, I started doing my first basic coding projects all in Java. I first started by making a basic calculator with Java’s GUI. Then I used a map of my town (Frisco) to make a shortest path calculator using Djikstra’s algorithm. 
                    In twelfth grade and up to now, I have gotten more interested in Arduinos. The main reason for this is because I realized what I was really interested in: the bridge between both software and hardware. I started off by doing basic Arduino projects. Soon after that, I got my own  breadboard and began using op amps in order to make a wide variety of circuits. These basic projects were very helpful in preparing me for many electrical engineering classes, some of which were very difficult. 
                </p>
                <h4>Other Activites: </h4>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was little, I have been very interested in sports, especially football, soccer, basketball, and volleyball. All of which I still play very often. During covid, I gained interest in mountain biking and I have been involved in a number of amateur races around the North Texas area. Due to the fact that my bike would break very often, I also spent countless hours working on my bike and learning how the parts worked and could be replaced. 
                    In addition to sports, I also go to the gym seven days a week. In the beginning of 2022, I was obese (according to my BMI), which was largely due to my lack of discipline. In the summer of that year, I decided that I no longer wanted to be obese. Since then, I supplemented playing sports with going to the gym and doing cardio. I also made another huge change to my life, which was controlling when and what I ate. Since 2022, I have lost approximately 55 pounds and I feel better than ever.
