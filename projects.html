                This is a C++ program that manages a resturant and (almost) all of its functions.

            <p>
                An rectifier circut is used to convert AC to DC. This is necessary for almost all household appliances and devices require DC, as the power that comes out of 
                our walls are AC. Usually, a rectifier is provided with the device (ex: the brick that comes with a charger). In this project, I wanted to create one at home
                through the use of an Arduino. The coding was done in C++ with the Arduino IDE, and I achieved a conversion efficency of 82%.

            <p>
                This server is one that I usually use to host my website (until it inevitably crashes). I constructed it by using a Raspberry Pi, a microproccessor,
                with a 64 bit version of Arm on it. I used Ubuntu 24.02 and Linux to get it started. I then made a custom template for Wordpress, as the original
                template would not work straight away.

        <div class="accordion-header"><b>Household Calorie Tracker</b></div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>In an Asian household it can be very difficult to track calories in our meals. The main reason for this is because when we cook, we usually put
                in however much of an ingredient that we think is appropriate, in other words, we don't measure our ingredients. 
                <br> <br>
                The main goal of this application is to help people in Asian household track their calories. The app will ask for all the ingredients required 
                for a certain type of dish. After that, the user needs to input how much of that ingreident was used in the dish. The app will aldready have 
                the calorie amount for various types of ingreidents, using information provided by the USDA. After the user inputs the amount of the ingredint 
                that is used, the app automitcally multipiles the amount by the respective calories in the ingreident. When all of the ingriendts are inputted, 
                the calorie profile of the dish will be saved under a name chosen by the user. The user can now track the calories in the dish, whever it is cooked.
                <br> <br>
                The app will be uploaded onto the IOS App Store and the Andrioid Google Play Store through the use of Swift and Kotlin. 
                <br> <br>
                This project is currently underway. Source code and an image of the application will be provided shortly.
